# Parking Space Monitoring System utilizing YOLO11 Object Detection

## Overview
This project demonstrates a Parking Space Monitoring System powered by YOLO11, an advanced deep learning-based object detection model. The system automatically detects and monitors parking spaces in real-time using a camera feed, providing accurate identification of vacant and occupied spots. It leverages the power of YOLO11 for high-speed and high-accuracy object detection, ensuring reliable results even in dynamic environments.

## Disclaimer
- I do not own the video. I was used it just for demonstration for this project.
- The yolo model used for this project was "yolo11n.pt" which I downloaded here ðŸ‘‰https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/#supported-tasks-and-modes .

Happy coding! ðŸ’œ
